## The general process for ARIMA models :

1.Visualizing the Time Series Data.

2.Making the time series data stationary.

3.Ploting the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts.

4.Constructing the ARIMA Model or Seasonal ARIMA based on the data.

5.Using the model for making predictions.

1.Import required Libraries for Time Series Data.

2.Visualize data for checking stationarity.

3.Make data stationary if it is not stationary.

4.Plot Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts for p and q values.

5.Now construct ARIMA Model or Seasonal ARIMA Model for the data.

6.Use this ARIMA Model or Seasonal ARIMA Model for predicting random or available data.
