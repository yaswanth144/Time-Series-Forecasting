                               The general process for ARIMA models is the following

                               1.Visualizing the Time Series Data
                               2.Making the time series data stationary
                               3.Ploting the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts
                               4.Constructing the ARIMA Model or Seasonal ARIMA based on the data
                               5.Using the model for making predictions
